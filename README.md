This app was created using HTML, CSS, React.js, Django, and PostgreSQL. HTML and CSS were used for the design of the website, React.js was used for the functionality of the chess game, and Django was used to make changes on the website for multiple users, and interact with the PostgreSQL database. The app follows all Chess rules, so illegal moves cannot be made, and allows for the following options: resigning, making a draw, and flipping the board. Every game played also has the corresponding PGN code created so that if a user wants to share a game through text it is easy to do so with PGN. Also, each game saved in the database has the PGN saved as well as all the moves made. PS. There can only be one instance of a game running at a time, so the game room will be full with 2 players in it.
